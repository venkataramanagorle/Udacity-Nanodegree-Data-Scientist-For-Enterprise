## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
A home is probably the most expensive purchase that a person will do in his or her lifetime. The most important constraint while buying a home is the value of the property. So, a good model that can predict the value of the property will help users to shortlist and buy their dream property.
Also, with increasing population and urbanization this model can help various stakeholders involved in the planning, construction and expansion of towns and cities.

Here I try to build a model for Ames Housing dataset to predict the hosue price using Regression Techniques. 

## Instructions <a name="instructions"></a>
You can run the House Prices Prediction.ipynb in this folder. Please make sure xgboost and lightgbm pacakges are installed.

## Results <a name="results"></a>
The main findings of the code has been mentioned in Jupyter notebook and corresponding HTML file.
Same findings have been explained at the **Medium blog post** [here](https://medium.com/@venkataramanagorle/house-prices-prediction-with-regression-fe673a6dfa85)
