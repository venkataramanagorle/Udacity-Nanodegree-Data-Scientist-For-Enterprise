## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I am using the Stack Overflow Developer Survey Data for the years 2018 and 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey to understand about the following questions

1. What is the general demographics of developers?
2. What are the features diffrentiating high earning developers from low earning developers?
3. What factors contribute towards developer satisfaction?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

Followed the CRISP DM process to do the analysis of the above questions.
